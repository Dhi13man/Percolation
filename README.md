# Percolation
IntelliJ IDEA IDE and JDK 13 is used in the build.
--

This is a project created as an assignment for the Princeton University course, Algorithms 1. 
A software model of the scientific concept of Percolation has been created here, as an implementation of the Union-Find algorithm. 

Possible applications are in the fields of Chemistry and physics, to find if a certain material is porous, conductive etc.


Note: The Interactive Percolation Visualizer, the Java libraries used are provided by the course, and not my own creation. The code behind the
Percolation class and the Percolation statistics calculating class, is my own.
